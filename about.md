I am a fourth-year engineering student and a future computer scientist. My passion for building through code brought me to the computer engineering faculty at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru. 

I am a STEM instructor and tech enthusiast who aims to share and inspire people into robotics, technology, and making up the future.
